# prior_elicitation

Interactive prior elicitation via prior predictive checks.

## Description

Gelman et al. (2017[^1]) note that "[t]he prior can often only be understood in the context of the likelihood."
As they point out, the prior predictive distribution is "a fundamental tool for understanding the effect of the prior on inference before data has been collected."
Indeed, one understands the implications of one's prior by iteratively specifying a prior and then viewing its prior predictive distribution.
This repository investigates and demonstrates how to specify one's prior based on such iterative understanding processes.

## Installation

In order to set up the necessary environment:

1. create an environment `prior_elicitation` with the help of [conda],
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
2. activate the new environment with
   ```
   conda activate prior_elicitation
   ```
3. install `prior_elicitation` with:
   ```
   python setup.py install # or `develop`
   ```

Optional and needed only once after `git clone`:

4. install several [pre-commit] git hooks with:
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```
   and checkout the configuration under `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
   The `-n, --no-verify` flag of `git commit` can be used to deactivate pre-commit hooks temporarily.

5. install [nbstripout] git hooks to remove the output cells of committed notebooks with:
   ```
   nbstripout --install --attributes notebooks/.gitattributes
   ```
   This is useful to avoid large diffs due to plots in your notebooks.
   A simple `nbstripout --uninstall` will revert these changes.


Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `environment.yaml` and eventually
   in `setup.cfg` if you want to ship and install your package via `pip` later on.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `environment.lock.yaml` for the exact reproduction of your
   environment with:
   ```
   conda env export -n prior_elicitation -f environment.lock.yaml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yaml` using:
   ```
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yaml --prune
   ```
